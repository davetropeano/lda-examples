lda-examples
============

This project contains several examples and tutorials for Linked Data for Applications (LDA).

`Note: if you don't have python 2.7, you need to install it before proceeding.`

Each example is in a self-contained subdirectory with a README.md file containing instructions for setting up and running it:

* [Todo Sample](https://github.com/ld4apps/lda-examples/blob/master/todo/README.md) (recommended starting point)
(recommended new users start with this and its corresponding [tutorial](http://ld4apps.github.io/developing-lda-applications/index.html)).
* [SetupShop](https://github.com/ld4apps/lda-examples/blob/master/setupshop/README.md)
* More to come ...
